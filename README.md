Simple Addon to keep track and overview of faction reputation and renown


## What is this for?

Over the last 20 years that WoW exists there came a lot of factions to collect reputation for. With **Dragonflight** there came a new and additional system called "Renown" for the so called "Main Factions" of the respective extension.

It can be very hard to keep track and overview of all those dozens of factions and I had the idea to create a neat little alternative for the default UI's "Reputation" tab at the Character frame. My first attempt for this was a WeakAura called [DF Factions by readi2play](https://wago.io/uJYumdJpX) and this one worked quite well for a good while. But as always with WeakAuras it suffers from the limitations blizzard layed upon it.

> Everything a WeakAura does has to be done within a single frame

Fore the fact that there will be more and more factions in the future, this WeakAura will reach a hard barrier it cannot pass anymore and therefore I decided to give it a rework in style of a standalone addon.
